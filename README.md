# azure-secure-cloud-projects
A startup migrated its infrastructure to the Azure cloud, but security controls were not yet properly configured. A developer exposed sensitive data stored in Azure to the public, an attacker gained access and stole credentials because MFA was not enabled. The company lost money as a result, as there were no billing alerts or monitoring in place.
